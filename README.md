# Lifelong Debt Calculator

In the weeks approaching my student finance application, I've been using the GOV.UK "maintenance loan calculator" a lot,
but I don't like how long it takes to complete the whole form, and because GOV.UK uses URL parameters, I thought this should be easy...

<br />

So, this simple UI will allow me to check my household income-based maintenance loan without having to complete the form over a hundred times.

## Note

I'm not a fan of Student Finance's lack of support for the middle-class, but I do appreciate the system. This application is made semi-jokingly.
